Yeah I know, but "maybe" this is the last one.

We're moving our work servers and I don't want to have my own vps alive anymore.

Keeping vm packages updated, wordpress updated, deleting spam comments... Too many things to do and I have no time for that.

And also, I'm getting tired of php.

So I decided to start using jekyll blog generator with the heroku free web dyno. The idea is simple, you write your posts, layout, pages, using simple markdown syntax and some ruby snippets and on every git push a fast static website is generated.

Lets go on with that ;)
