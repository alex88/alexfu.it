Having mysql running on a ramdisk can be a much faster way to unit test a database intensive application.

Supposing you've installed mysql or percosa server via homebrew (cause the paths it uses) you can directly run this script to create a virtual disk and run a mysql instance on it.
It will create a simple configuration file stored in /usr/local/etc/my_ramdisk.cnf which will be used by the additional mysql instance.

By default the server will run on port 3307 listening on 0.0.0.0.

Here is the attached script:

Just run it via ./mysql\_ramdisk.rb and shutdown using ./mysql\_ramdisk shutdown ;)
